#1. Write a program for assignment operators and explain each
# Assignment Operators
x = 10  # Simple assignment
y = 5   # Simple assignment

# Using +=
x += 5  # x = x + 5
print("After x += 5, x =", x)  # x is now 15

# Using -=
y -= 2  # y = y - 2
print("After y -= 2, y =", y)  # y is now 3

# Using *=
x *= 2  # x = x * 2
print("After x *= 2, x =", x)  # x is now 30

# Using /=
y /= 2  # y = y / 2
print("After y /= 2, y =", y)  # y is now 1.5

# Using %=
x %= 7  # x = x % 7
print("After x %= 7, x =", x)  # x is now 2

# Explanation of Assignment Operators:

 # =: Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.
# +=: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
# -=: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
# *=: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
# /=: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
# %=: Takes the modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

# 2.  Write a program for arithmatic , logical , membership operators and explain use of each
# Arithmetic Operators

b = 5

print("Arithmetic Operations:")
print("a + b =", a + b)  # Addition
print("a - b =", a - b)  # Subtraction
print("a * b =", a * b)  # Multiplication
print("a / b =", a / b)  # Division
print("a % b =", a % b)  # Modulus
print("a ** b =", a ** b)  # Exponentiation
print("a // b =", a // b)  # Floor Division

# Logical Operators
x = True

print("\nLogical Operations:")
print("x and y =", x and y)  # Logical AND
print("x or y =", x or y)    # Logical OR
print("not x =", not x)      # Logical NOT

# Membership Operators

print("\nMembership Operations:")
print("2 in list_example:", 2 in list_example)  # Checks if 2 is in the list

# 3.  Calculate the area of a circle.
import math

radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))

# 4. Calculate the area of a triangle.
base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))

# 5.  Calculate the area of a rectangle.
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))

Outputs: 
After x += 5, x = 15
After y -= 2, y = 3
After x *= 2, x = 30
After y /= 2, y = 1.5
After x %= 7, x = 2
Arithmetic Operations:
a + b = 15
a - b = 5
a * b = 50
a / b = 2.0
a % b = 0
a ** b = 100000
a // b = 2

Logical Operations:
x and y = False
x or y = True
not x = False

Membership Operations:
2 in list_example: True
10 not in list_example: True
